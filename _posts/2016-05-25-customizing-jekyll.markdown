Starting your website with Jekyll is the best of both words; you can find great templates that start you out with a professional looking website, and it is easy and fast to customize.

### Themes Galore!
You can find tons of [free themes](http://jekyllthemes.org) and [paid themes](https://jekyllthemes.io) to start you off with a great looking website. Since there is a large community of Jekyll sites hosted for free via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), you can easily find a great open-source starter template, fork it on GitHub and start customizing. I forked the theme for this site from [this template](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo), modified it heavily and then created my own [starter template](https://github.com/jehartzog/indigo) with the changes I made. In keeping with GitHub style, the original author was able to pull some of my improvements back into his [own template](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo/issues/117).

### Free Hosting with GitHub Pages
While hosting on AWS or another cloud service can be had for extremely cheap these days, under $5 per month, it still costs money and requires you to set up the server and keep it running. Why pay for hosting when you can get it for free with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com)?! While the service has a few limitations on what you can do with Jekyll (no custom plugins), it overall works fantastic, especially considering the (lack of) cost.

### Page History Archived with GIT
Of course you use some version of source control for all your projects, but it's easy for a blog site to get looked over. With a WordPress site, you end up will all your precious posts in some hosted database doesn't keep a completely history of edits and changes. You need to deal with database backups, custom plugins, and everything else needed to re-assemble your site if you ever need to migrate or shift it. With Jekyll, all you have is a single flat file structure that can be easily tracked with GIT.
