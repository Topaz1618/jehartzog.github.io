## About TutoringZone

With thousands of enrollees, [TutoringZone](http://www.tutoringzone.com) is one of the largest online teaching organization serving University of Florida and Florida State University students.

By providing reviews tailored to individual professors and Q&A sessions with their knowledgeable tutors, TutoringZone has been boosting student performance since 1997.

## Development Support

Since January of 2015 I have been the sole developer supporting TutoringZone's website. Some of the more major improvements I implemented were [horizontally scaling Moodle](/blog/horz-scale-moodle) and transitioning to [source code management (Git)](/blog/to-git-or-not-to-git).
