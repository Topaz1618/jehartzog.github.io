My development work history comes with an unusual gap of 5 years, primarily caused by the unfortunate **lack of wifi and cellular service when surrounded by a steel hull hundreds of feet under the ocean surface**.

In May 2009, while I was still actively developing StickWars, I graduated from from college and then went to [Nuclear Power School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Power_School) to start 24 months of training on [nuclear power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressurized_water_reactor) and [submarine technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine#Technology).

As my studies continued, I passed off active development of StickWars and its successors to other companies to continue growing the franchise. I knew that my future would take me completely 'off-the-grid' and was willing to give up control of my app to keep it alive in my absence.

## Enter the Black Hole of the Ocean

Once I finally arrived at my [submarine](https:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles-class_submarine), my departure from the online world was complete. Nothing is as effective as cutting off your network access to the world than being surrounded by a steel shell with no means of connecting to the internet for months a time. Most people find it hard to imagine living life completely off the grid, and after going through it I have no desire to disappear under the sea again.
